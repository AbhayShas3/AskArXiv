Answer:

How can neural networks be made more robust for face recognition tasks?

To improve the robustness of face recognition tasks, research has focused on developing algorithms that can handle various types of noise and variations in the input data. Pairwise neural-network systems have been shown to outperform multiclass neural-network classifiers in terms of predictive accuracy on corrupted face images (Uglov et al., "Comparing Robustness of Pairwise and Multiclass Neural-Network Systems for Face Recognition", 2016). Additionally, regularization techniques can be used to control overfitting and improve the generalization of support vector machines (SVMs) (Xu et al., "Robustness and Regularization of Support Vector Machines", 2010).

In the context of image classification, merging the opinions of multiple human experts can also improve the accuracy of the model (Martin et al., "Human Expert Fusion for Image Classification", 2008). However, it is important to consider the amount of certainty each expert has for each pixel of the image when fusing their opinions.

The architecture of the brain has also been studied in relation to natural computation (Kaiser, "Brain Architecture: A Design for Natural Computation", 2008). Research has shown that the spatial and topological organization of neuronal and cortical networks facilitates robustness against failures, fast processing, and balanced network activation. These findings may inspire new computer architectures.
